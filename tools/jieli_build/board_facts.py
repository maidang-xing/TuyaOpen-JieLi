"""Read the hardware facts a Jieli board declares in its Kconfig.

The staging hooks apply board-specific values to the vendor SDK: the USB device
macro, the memory map, the log and service UARTs and the panel. Those values
used to be per-board branches inside this package, and briefly a JSON file
beside each board. They are now ordinary Kconfig settings under
``boards/JIELI/<board>/Kconfig``, so the platform reads them from the evaluated
config the way it reads every other setting, and a new board is data rather
than a platform edit.

Values that would name a vendor macro stay semantic in Kconfig -- ``usb_role``
is ``host`` or ``device``, the panel is its model -- and the mapping to the
vendor's vocabulary lives here, in the platform. Pin names are the SDK's own
vocabulary and the board writes them as the vendor headers spell them.

Nothing falls back to a default. A fact the platform acts on is a fact the
board has to state: a missing setting is a build error naming the symbol, never
a silently inherited value. A default would only move the hardcoding.
