"""Create and clean an isolated Jieli SDK staging tree.

The staging tree is kept across builds rather than deleted and recreated. The
vendor make's objects live inside it, so deleting it costs a full recompile of
every vendor source -- tens of seconds, and the largest single cost of a build
that changed nothing. Instead the tree records what it was built from, in a
state file beside it, and a tree whose inputs all still match is left exactly as
it was. Any input that cannot be shown to match forces a full rebuild: a stale
staging tree produces a wrong image silently, which is far worse than a slow
build.
